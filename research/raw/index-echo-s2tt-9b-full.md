**Index-Echo-S2TT-9B** translates speech into text using a Qwen3-Omni AuT audio encoder, an audio connector, and an Index-Translate-9B decoder. The released package accepts audio or video files and writes bilingual subtitles with sentence timestamps. Its packaged inference interface supports **Chinese → English, Japanese, or Spanish**.

This is the speech-to-text member of the Index-Translate family. The [2B sibling](https://huggingface.co/IndexTeam/Index-Echo-S2TT-2B) provides the same packaged interface at a different model size.

## Architecture

![Index-Echo speech-to-text and speech-to-speech architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bilibili/Index-Translate/main/docs/assets/index-echo-architecture.png)

The report's upper path shows the S2TT model: source audio → Qwen3-Omni AuT encoder → audio connector → Index-Translate decoder → translated target text. This card covers that speech-to-text path; the lower path adds speech generation for S2ST.

## Model and training

The [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.40181) describes end-to-end training on speech translation: acoustic input, target-language instructions, and translated text are represented in a single sequence. The model learns to interpret source audio directly while using the multilingual text decoder for translation. It produces the source transcript and target translation together with per-sentence timestamps.

The self-contained export includes the trained audio encoder and connector as safetensors, plus the Qwen3.5-family decoder in Hugging Face format under `llm/`. See `MODEL_INFO.json` for the export's checkpoint details. The name's **9B** refers to the decoder size; the package also contains the audio components.

## Inference

Install the Hugging Face CLI, download the package, and install its inference requirements. System `ffmpeg` must be available on `PATH`.

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub
hf download IndexTeam/Index-Echo-S2TT-9B --local-dir ./Index-Echo-S2TT-9B
pip install -r Index-Echo-S2TT-9B/requirements.txt
python3 Index-Echo-S2TT-9B/infer.py input.mp4 --target-lang en --out out_dir
```

The official inference guide uses `torch==2.11.0` and `transformers==5.6.0`, with `safetensors`, `librosa`, `soundfile`, and `silero-vad`. Keep the packaged requirements and a CUDA-compatible PyTorch build when setting up the environment. See the [S2TT guide](https://github.com/bilibili/Index-Translate/tree/main/inference/echo-s2tt) for the GitHub wrapper and additional examples.

Outputs are `out_dir/input.srt` (Chinese transcript and target translation in each cue) and `out_dir/input.windows.jsonl` (raw per-window output and a final summary).

### Default inference settings

| Setting / CLI option | Released default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs` | Required, one or more files | Audio/video paths, processed sequentially |
| `--out` | Required | Directory for SRT and per-window JSONL outputs |
| `--temperature` | `0.0` | Greedy decoding (`do_sample=False`); positive values enable sampling |
| `--max-new-tokens` | `2000` | Output-token budget per audio window |
| `--max-win` | `60.0` seconds | VAD audio-window cap |
| `--ctx-k` | `5` | Maximum number of previous output windows used as context |
| `--target-lang` | `en` | Target choices: `en`, `ja`, `es` |
| `--glossary` | Empty string | Inline terminology; for example `原名:Translated name` |
| `--glossary-file` | Empty string | UTF-8 terminology file; takes priority over `--glossary` |
| `--device` | `cuda:0` | Device used to load the model |
| Model dtype | `torch.bfloat16` | Set by the package loader, not a CLI option |
| Text stopping | Tokenizer EOS or `<|im_end|>` | Stops generation; padding uses tokenizer EOS |

These defaults are identical for the 2B and 9B subtitle scripts. The package does not explicitly override `top_p`, `top_k`, or repetition penalties; values for those settings follow the decoder generation configuration. The prompt prefills an empty `<think>` block, as in the released script. The greedy speech-transcription/translation settings belong to the speech package; they are distinct from the text-model client settings.

```bash
python3 Index-Echo-S2TT-9B/infer.py input.mp4 \
  --target-lang ja --out out_ja \
  --temperature 0 --max-new-tokens 2000 --max-win 60 --ctx-k 5 \
  --glossary "原名1:訳名1,原名2:訳名2" --device cuda:0
```

`ffmpeg` converts input to 16 kHz mono audio. Silero VAD divides it into windows; inference runs sequentially and feeds previous transcript/translation windows into the context slot. `--glossary` supplies terminology, and `--glossary-file` reads the same format from a file with priority over the inline value. Context and glossary instructions help with consistency but do not guarantee exact compliance.

## Evaluation

On the report's in-house video translation set, Index-Echo-9B achieves **0.857 MT judge**, **0.102 median ASR error**, and **0.488 s start-time MAE**. Its translation score lies between Qwen3.8-Omni-Flash (0.887) and Gemini-3.1-Pro with thinking (0.849).

The set contains **140 total windows**, each 50–60 seconds long: **20 windows per direction** for Chinese → English/Japanese/Korean/Spanish/Portuguese/Arabic and English → Chinese. This broader evaluation setup is separate from the released `infer.py` interface, which exposes Chinese → English/Japanese/Spanish.

| Model | MT judge ↑ | ASR error (median) ↓ | Start-time MAE (s) ↓ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.8-Omni-Flash | **0.887** | 0.112 | 1.004 |
| **Index-Echo-9B** | 0.857 | 0.102 | 0.488 |
| Gemini-3.1-Pro (thinking) | 0.849 | 0.169 | 1.824 |
| Qwen3.8-LiveTranslate | 0.833 | 0.186 | — |
| Index-Echo-2B | 0.825 | **0.088** | **0.395** |
| Gemini-2.5-Flash (thinking) | 0.817 | 0.201 | 2.402 |
| Gemini-2.5-Flash | 0.757 | 0.479 | 1.746 |
| Qwen3-Omni | 0.700 | 0.139 | 1.145 |
| FireRed Audio | 0.448 | 0.128 | 0.765 |
| SeamlessM4T-v2 | 0.060 | 1.000 | — |

The MT judge averages Gemini-3.1-Pro's per-line quality ratings on a 0/0.5/1 scale. ASR error compares the source transcription with the reference transcript; the table reports its median. Start-time MAE is the mean absolute difference between predicted and reference sentence start times, in seconds. Bold metric values mark the best result in each column.

Qwen3.8-LiveTranslate was evaluated in streaming mode. Dashes indicate unavailable timestamp outputs. SeamlessM4T-v2 received unchunked inputs of approximately 57 seconds, beyond its approximately 30-second effective range, and does not support the line-level timestamp instructions used here. Its score should be interpreted under those input conditions. These are in-house results, not a universal ranking across speech tasks or deployment settings. See the [report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2609.40181) and [evaluation tables](https://github.com/bilibili/Index-Translate/blob/main/docs/evaluation.md) for the protocol.

## Package files and limitations

| File or directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config.json` | Package configuration: component paths and inference entry point |
| `infer.py`, `requirements.txt` | Packaged subtitle inference and dependencies |
| `llm/` | Index-Translate-derived decoder and tokenizer |
| `audio_tower.safetensors`, `audio_config.json` | Trained AuT audio encoder |
| `connector.safetensors` | Audio-to-decoder connector |
| `MODEL_INFO.json` | Source checkpoint and export information |

The root `config.json` describes the complete S2TT package. Use `infer.py` to load it; the decoder’s Transformers configuration remains at `llm/config.json`.

Use a CUDA GPU with enough VRAM for the 9B decoder and audio components; the 9B package requires more memory than the 2B package. Processing is sequential within each input file; separate files can be assigned to separate GPUs.

Timestamp accuracy and transcript/translation quality can vary with audio conditions and content. Greedy decoding may repeat on out-of-distribution inputs; the script accepts a positive `--temperature` to enable sampling, which can change both translation and timing. Review subtitles when precise alignment or terminology is required. The package is a file-based subtitle interface; its windowing does not establish a real-time latency guarantee.

For speech generation and long-video dubbing, use the separate [S2ST packages](https://github.com/bilibili/Index-Translate/tree/main/inference/echo-s2st) or the [video dubbing pipeline](https://github.com/bilibili/Index-Translate/tree/main/video-dub).
