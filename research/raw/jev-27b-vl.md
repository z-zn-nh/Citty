# autotrust/JEV-27B-VL

### JEV-27B that can see: the same System 1 decisions and System 2, now on images

**autotrust/JEV-27B-VL** is [autotrust/JEV-27B](https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-27B) with vision. 

| | what it does | output |
|---|---|---|
| **System 1** (`POST /v1/decide`) | typed decisions: yes/no · pick one of 2–256 options · rate 0–5, over text and images; prompts up to 256K tokens | a calibrated probability for every option, in one forward pass |
| **System 2** (`autotrust/JEV-27B-VL`) | the unmodified Qwen3.8-27B, optionally thinking step by step, with image input | text / reasoning |

## New (3 October 2026): robot arm and computer use

Every step below is **one System 1 decision**: a camera image or a screenshot in, a probability for every action out, in
a single forward pass.

**Robot arm: pick and place from a camera image.** At every step System 1 looks at the top camera image and answers two
questions: is the target left or right of the gripper, and above or below it? The arm moves accordingly and halves its
step whenever an answer flips. It grasps the cube, carries it and drops it in the tray (MuJoCo simulation).

<video src="https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-27B-VL/resolve/main/videos/robot_arm_pick_place.mp4" controls autoplay loop muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

**75% of 20 random scenes completed, the best of the JEV family.** Every cube it grasped ended in the tray (15 of 15);
every miss was a grasp 3.0–3.7 cm off target. About 240 ms per decision.

**Computer use: screenshot → which element to click.** A real browser (headless Chromium). Every clickable element gets a
numbered box; System 1 picks the next click (or "the task is complete"), the browser clicks it, and the loop repeats.

<video src="https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-27B-VL/resolve/main/videos/computer_use_shop.mp4" controls autoplay loop muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

**95% of 60 random multi-step tasks completed** (shop, settings, mail; 3–7 clicks each), about 0.26 s per click. The
colour swatches carry no text, so that click is decided from the screenshot alone.

Same scenes and tasks for every model in the family:

| | **JEV-27B-VL** | [JEV-9B](https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-9B) | [GEV-26B-Decide](https://huggingface.co/autotrust/GEV-26B-Decide) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| robot arm: pick and place (20 scenes) | **75%** | 50% | 40% |
| computer use: numbered boxes + element text (60 tasks) | 95% | 95% | 95% |
| computer use: numbered boxes only | 10% | 37% | 15% |
| time per robot-arm decision | 239 ms | 163 ms | 61 ms |

* Use System 1 for simple visual questions inside a control loop. Asked to pick one of 8 motor commands directly, it
  completed 0 of 10 scenes.
* For computer use, give it the element text (as an accessibility tree would). With the numbered boxes alone it often
  declares the task complete too early.

Demo code: [JEV-9B `vl/demos/`](https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-9B/tree/main/vl/demos) (set `JEV_URL` to this
server). Per-episode results: [`reports/demos/`](reports/demos).

## New (1 October 2026)

* **System 1 over plain HTTP.** `serve_decide.py` adds `POST /v1/decide` to the vLLM server: send
  `{kind, state, question, options}` and get a calibrated probability for every option, for text or images. See
  [Quick start](#quick-start).
* **Up to 256 options per choice question**, with no retraining. Zero-shot on CLINC150 with all 150 intents as options:
  89.5% with intent names alone, 93.8% with a one-line description per option. See
  [Choice questions with up to 256 options](#choice-questions-with-up-to-256-options).
* **How to write prompts, measured.** One-line "use when" descriptions for similar options help; question wording, JSON
  vs plain text and extra instructions make no measurable difference. See [Writing System 1 prompts](#writing-system-1-prompts).
* **256K-token prompts.** Decisions that hinge on one sentence hidden at a random depth in up to 250K tokens of text:
  20 of 20 correct at every length tested. See [Context length](#context-length).

## Highlight: zero-shot short-video recommendation (for TikTok-style feeds)

A short-video feed has to decide, for every user and every new clip, whether to show it. JEV-27B-VL System 1 can make that
call from the pictures alone: it looks at the covers of the last 5 videos a user watched plus one candidate cover, and returns
**P(this user watches it)** in one forward pass. It needs no interaction logs, no item embeddings and no training, so a
brand-new video can be ranked the moment it is uploaded, before anyone has watched it.

Offline evaluation on [MicroLens-100k](https://github.com/westlake-repl/MicroLens), a public dataset from a real short-video
platform with the original covers: for 200 users, the video each one actually watched next is hidden among 19 videos other
users watched within ±3 days (what the feed would have been showing), and every method ranks the 20 candidates.

![zero-shot short-video recommendation](image_recommendation.png)

| method | uses interaction logs? | AUC | HR@5 | NDCG@10 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| random order | no | 0.489 | 0.205 | 0.219 |
| title similarity (TF-IDF) | no | 0.602 | 0.385 | 0.367 |
| JEV-27B-VL System 1, titles only | **no, zero-shot** | 0.649 | 0.455 | 0.399 |
| **JEV-27B-VL System 1, covers only** | **no, zero-shot** | **0.727** | **0.590** | 0.498 |
| item-based collaborative filtering | yes, 59,045 other users | 0.728 | 0.490 | 0.503 |

* **Matches collaborative filtering with zero behaviour data:** the same AUC as item-based CF learned from 59,045 users'
  watch histories (difference 0.000, 95% interval −0.041 to +0.040), and a higher top-5 hit rate (59% vs 49%).
* **Solves the cold-start problem:** collaborative filtering needs co-watch history; JEV only needs the cover, so new videos
  and new creators can be recommended from the first second.
* **Pictures beat words:** covers alone score +0.078 AUC over titles (95% interval +0.031 to +0.126).
* **Fast enough for a ranking stage:** 20 candidate covers scored in about 2.6 s on one GPU in the live demo.

## Watch it decide

Every move below is one System 1 decision: a probability for each possible action, read off in a single forward pass. The
panels show the action probabilities and the time each decision took.

**Super Mario Bros.** Each step is a movement choice plus a jump decision, about 150 ms per decision (video at 5× speed).

<video src="https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-27B-VL/resolve/main/videos/vl1.mp4" controls autoplay loop muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

**Rubik's Cube.** Solving a 25-turn scramble, choosing each move from 11 standard formulas, about 46 ms per decision
(10× replay).

<video src="https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-27B-VL/resolve/main/videos/vl2.mp4" controls autoplay loop muted playsinline width="100%"></video>

**Tetris.** Choosing the column and orientation of each piece, about 122 ms per decision (5× speed).

**Quick, Draw!** Guessing what a player is sketching, stroke by stroke, among 16 answers. On 320 real players' sketches
from the Quick, Draw! dataset it names the drawing **88%** of the time once it is finished, and **62%** of the time when only
60% of the strokes are down (random guessing: 6%). About 270 ms per guess.

## Highlight: agent judge

**Plan-RewardBench (ACL 2026).** Which of two complete trajectories of a tool-using agent is better? On 1,171 pairs (planning,
error recovery, safe refusal, tool irrelevance), System 1 reaches **73.2%** macro-average accuracy, the top of the paper's
table (Table 4): Qwen-Plus 70.0, DeepSeek-V3.2 69.6, Inf-ORM-Llama3.1-70B 69.2, Gemini-3-Flash 69.1, GPT-5 68.5.

**AgentRewardBench (2025, with screenshots).**

Did the web agent really finish the task? Given the user's goal, the agent's actions and final message, and the final
screenshot, System 1 returns P(task completed) in one forward pass, zero-shot. On
[AgentRewardBench](https://agent-reward-bench.github.io) (McGill, 2025; 1,302 expert-labelled trajectories from GPT-4o, Claude
3.7, Llama 3.3 and Qwen2.5-VL agents) its precision is **higher than every judge on the official leaderboard at that judge's own
recall**:

## Highlight: multimodal judge

Given an image, a question and two answers, System 1 says which answer is better, zero-shot and in one forward pass per order.
On [VL-RewardBench](https://vl-rewardbench.github.io) (CVPR 2025, 1,247 human-verified pairs) it reaches **78.3% overall
accuracy**, above every model on its official leaderboard (26 models, updated May 2025):

| judge | general | hallucination | reasoning | **overall** | macro |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **JEV-27B-VL System 1** | 58.0 | **83.2** | **78.2** | **78.3** | **73.1** |

On the newer [Multimodal RewardBench 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16899) (Meta, December 2025), which includes the current
generation of judges (1,000 expert-annotated pairs per task; other rows from the paper's Table 2):

| judge | text-to-image | image editing | interleaved | reasoning | average |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gemini 3 Pro | 74.4 | 74.9 | 76.4 | 79.5 | 76.3 |
| GPT-5 | 70.5 | 73.8 | 74.4 | 70.2 | 72.2 |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 70.5 | 71.3 | 75.1 | 66.6 | 70.9 |
| Qwen3-VL-32B | 64.1 | 67.3 | 70.5 | 56.6 | 64.6 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 63.1 | 66.5 | 69.4 | 57.5 | 64.1 |

| Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B | 62.0 | 64.8 | 69.0 | 55.9 | 62.9 |
| GPT-4o | 60.3 | 65.0 | 61.5 | 51.9 | 59.7 |

Text-to-image judging comes within 1.3 points of GPT-5; the four-task average is at the level of GPT-4.1 and Qwen3-VL-32B.
GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro stay ahead, and image editing is the weakest task.

## Benchmarks

JEV-27B-VL gives the same text decisions as [autotrust/JEV-27B](https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-27B): on 1,000
answer-checking decisions the mean probability difference is 0.010 and 99.8% fall on the same side of 0.5. The text results
below were measured with JEV-27B; the image result was measured with JEV-27B-VL.

### System 2

| benchmark | result |
|---|---:|
| HumanEval pass@1 (greedy) | **78.0%**, identical to Qwen3.8-27B |

## Quick start

```bash
hf download autotrust/JEV-27B-VL --local-dir JEV-27B-VL
bash JEV-27B-VL/serve.sh          # vLLM on :8000; one GPU with 80 GB or more
```

`serve.sh` runs `serve_decide.py`: the standard vLLM OpenAI server, with the same flags as `vllm serve`, plus a
`POST /v1/decide` route for System 1.

```bash
python3 JEV-27B-VL/serve_decide.py --model JEV-27B-VL --served-model-name autotrust/JEV-27B-VL \
  --enable-lora --max-lora-rank 32 --lora-modules jev-decision=JEV-27B-VL/adapter_vllm \
  --logprobs-mode processed_logprobs --max-model-len 32768 --enable-prefix-caching --mamba-cache-mode align \
  --limit-mm-per-prompt '{"image": 8}' --max-num-seqs 8 --trust-request-chat-template
```

Set `MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144` before `serve.sh` for the full 256K context (see [Context length](#context-length)).

### System 1: `POST /v1/decide`

Send a question and get back a calibrated probability for every option. The server builds the decision prompt, reads
the option tokens and applies the decision head's bias and temperature, so any HTTP client works.

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/decide -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "kind": "choice",
  "state": "Customer: my card was charged twice for one coffee.",
  "question": "Which team should handle this?",
  "options": ["billing", "shipping", "tech support"]}'
```

```json
{"kind": "choice", "effective_kind": "choice", "options": ["billing", "shipping", "tech support"],
 "probabilities": [0.9969, 0.0000, 0.0031], "choice_index": 0, "choice": "billing",
 "adaptation": "native", "protocol": "jev27-bare-v1", "model": "autotrust/JEV-27B-VL",
 "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 49, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 50}, "num_model_requests": 1, "elapsed_seconds": ...}
```

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `noul`: yes/no, probabilities for `["false", "true"]` · `score`: a 0–5 scale, for `"0"`…`"5"` · `choice`: for your `options` |
| `state` | what the decision is about: a string, a JSON object, or a list that mixes text and images |
| `question` | one question about the state |
| `options` | `choice` only: 2–256 strings |

For images, make `state` a list; each image is placed where it appears. Images can be data URLs or `https://` URLs.

```python
import base64, requests

def image(path):
    return {"image": "data:image/jpeg;base64," + base64.b64encode(open(path, "rb").read()).decode()}

def decide(kind, state, question, options=None):
    body = {"kind": kind, "state": state, "question": question, **({"options": options} if options else {})}
    r = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/v1/decide", json=body).json()
    return dict(zip(r["options"], r["probabilities"]))

decide("noul", ["Photo: ", image("photo.jpg")], "Is this scenario one where: the image shows food or cooking?")
# e.g. {'false': 0.00, 'true': 1.00}
decide("choice", ["Listing photo: ", image("item.jpg"), "\nSeller title: wireless earbuds, barely used"],
       "Which category fits this listing?", ["electronics", "clothing", "home and kitchen", "toys"])
```

Text-only decisions give the same results as [autotrust/JEV-27B](https://huggingface.co/autotrust/JEV-27B).
`GET /v1/decide/info` reports the option limit and the temperatures.

<details>
<summary>Without <code>serve_decide.py</code>: plain <code>vllm serve</code> and client-side math</summary>

Start the server with `vllm serve` and the same flags, then ask for the option tokens yourself and apply the bundled
bias and temperature. Pass `top_k: 0` and `top_p: 1.0`: the model's `generation_config.json` sets `top_k=20` and
`top_p=0.95`, vLLM applies them as request defaults, and with `--logprobs-mode processed_logprobs` they would truncate
the returned probabilities and zero out less likely options.

```python
import json, math, requests

DH = json.load(open(f"{B}/adapter_vllm/decision_head.json"))
T = json.load(open(f"{B}/calibration.json"))["per_kind"]

### System 2 on images

```python
chart = {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image("chart.png")["image"]}}   # OpenAI-style image part
requests.post("http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions", json={
    "model": "autotrust/JEV-27B-VL",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [chart, {"type": "text", "text": "What does this chart show?"}]}],
    "max_tokens": 1024, "chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": False}})
```

## Choice questions with up to 256 options

`choice` takes 2–256 options in one question. The first 16 are labelled A–P, the labels the decision head was trained
on. Beyond 16, the labels continue with Q–Z and then two-letter labels that are single tokens (AA, AB, …), read the same
way, with no retraining. The response's `adaptation` field says `native` (up to 16 options) or `wide-labels`.

Zero-shot intent classification with every intent offered at once (accuracy on 400 test utterances per row):

| dataset | options | intent names only | names + a one-line description each |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| MASSIVE (en) | 59 | 83.2% | — |
| BANKING77 | 64 | 79.0% | 83.8% |
| BANKING77 | 77 (all) | 74.5% | 81.0% |
| CLINC150 | 64 | 94.8% | 97.3% |
| CLINC150 | 128 | 90.7% | 94.5% |
| CLINC150 | 150 (all) | 89.5% | 93.8% |

* **One `choice` question beats one yes/no question per option**, and costs one forward pass instead of one per option:
  83.2% vs 78.0% on MASSIVE, 78.8% vs 67.0% on BANKING77 (64 options), 94.5% vs 82.0% on CLINC150 (64 options).
* **Calibration at 150 options** (CLINC150): ECE 0.079 with names only (mean confidence 0.84 against 89.5% accuracy,
  slightly under-confident) and 0.034 with descriptions.
* **Speed** (one B200, 8 requests in flight, `--max-num-seqs 8`): a 150-option question takes a median 1.4 s with names
  only (about 790 prompt tokens) and 2.6 s with descriptions (about 3,100 tokens). Above 128 options the server reads the
  option tokens in two passes; the second reuses the cached prompt.

## Writing System 1 prompts

What we measured on the intent-classification sets above (400 utterances per variant):

1. **Facts in `state`, one question in `question`.** `state` holds everything the decision depends on; `question` asks
   one thing about it. Plain text and JSON both work: a JSON `state` scored the same as plain text (83.8% vs 83.2%,
   79.0% vs 79.0%, 94.5% vs 94.8%).
2. **Ask about all candidates in one `choice` question**, not one yes/no question per candidate (see above).
3. **Give similar options a one-line "use when" description.** This was the only change that clearly helped: +4.8
   points on BANKING77 (64 options), +2.5 on CLINC150 (64) and +4.3 on CLINC150 (all 150). The line should say what
   separates the option from its neighbours:
   ```
   [options]
   A) card arrival: use when users ask about the status or delivery of a physical card.
   B) card delivery estimate: use when users ask about the expected arrival time or delivery speed of a new card.
   C) Refund not showing up: use when a customer cannot see a completed refund in their account or statement.
   D) request refund: use when a user asks how to initiate or the timing of a refund for a purchase.
   ```
   More text did not help further. Longer rules with "do not use for …" clauses (about three times the tokens) and two
   worked examples per option scored 83.8% and 84.0% on BANKING77 (vs 83.8% for one line), and 97.3% and 96.0% on CLINC150
   (vs 97.3%). Generic descriptions did not help either: CLINC150's own intent descriptions scored 94.5%, against 94.8%
   for names alone.
4. **Wording barely matters.** A domain-specific question, an extra instruction ("Choose the single best-matching
   intent"), a JSON `state` and alphabetical option order all stayed within ±1.5 points of the plain prompt, inside the
   ±1.8-point sampling noise of 400 items. Keep prompts plain.
5. **Phrase `noul` so that "true" is the outcome you want the probability of**, e.g. "Is the customer asking for a
   refund?". Our demos use "Is this scenario one where: …?" for properties of a text or an image.
6. **One option per line.** The template lists one option per line, so keep newlines out of option text.
7. **Check order sensitivity when it matters.** About 7% of 16-option answers change with option order alone. For
   pairwise judging, ask both orders and average; on RewardBench pairs the two orders agreed 96% of the time.
8. **Use the probability, not just the top option.** Act automatically above a threshold you validated on your own data,
   and send the rest to System 2 or a person.

## Context length

The backbone's native context is **262,144 tokens (256K)**, and System 1 accepts prompts up to that length when vLLM is
started with `--max-model-len 262144`. We tested decisions that hinge on a single sentence placed at a random depth in
long real text (concatenated PubMedQA abstracts): a yes/no question (was the refund for order #N approved or rejected?)
and a 16-option question (which room is the spare part for machine M kept in?), 10 of each per length.

| prompt length | yes/no correct | 16-option correct | mean probability on the right answer | median latency |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4K (4,235 tokens) | 10/10 | 10/10 | 0.999 | 0.6 s |
| 32K (32,157 tokens) | 10/10 | 10/10 | 0.998 | 3.0 s |
| 64K (64,070 tokens) | 10/10 | 10/10 | 0.997 | 5.7 s |
| 128K (127,895 tokens) | 10/10 | 10/10 | 0.997 | 12.2 s |
| 192K (191,659 tokens) | 10/10 | 10/10 | 0.997 | 20.2 s |
| 250K (249,507 tokens) | 10/10 | 10/10 | 0.997 | 28.7 s |

Latency is one request at a time on one B200 and is almost all prompt processing (about 8,700 tokens per second at 250K).

Memory: the KV cache takes about 65 KB per token, so a full 256K prompt needs about 17 GB on top of the 52 GB of weights
(tested on a 183 GB B200). On an 80 GB GPU, start with `--max-model-len 131072`.

## Serving notes

* **`--max-num-seqs 8` is required.** With more than 8 sequences in one batch, vLLM's LoRA path for this multimodal model
  class returns wrong System 1 probabilities (the text-only JEV-27B is not affected). With the cap, results match JEV-27B at
  any client concurrency; requests beyond 8 simply queue.
* **Throughput** on one B200 with the cap: 24 short text decisions in about 1.4 s; 4,000 image decisions with 6 images each
  in 316 s (about 13 per second).
* **`--trust-request-chat-template`** lets `/v1/decide` (and the client-side code above) render the raw decision template
  for image decisions. System 2 uses the model's own chat template.
* **`serve_decide.py`** needs the vLLM development build this model was tested with (September 2026): it uses
  `logprob_token_ids` and that build's server layout. Everything else is plain vLLM, and all OpenAI endpoints stay
  available on the same port.
* **Calling `/v1/completions` or `/v1/chat/completions` for System 1 yourself:** pass `top_k: 0` and `top_p: 1.0`. The
  model's generation config sets `top_k=20` and `top_p=0.95`; vLLM applies them as request defaults, and they would
  truncate the returned probabilities. `serve_decide.py` does this for you.
* Images are resized by the Qwen3.8 processor. Downscaling large images first (for example to at most 448 px) keeps the
  number of vision tokens and the latency low.

## Limitations

* System 1's decision head was trained on text. Decisions over images are zero-shot: they are well ordered in the
  experiment above, but their calibration on image tasks has not been measured systematically.
* The short-video recommendation result is an offline evaluation on one dataset (200 users), ranking from covers only.
* Choices with more than 16 options use labels the decision head never saw in training. Accuracy holds up (see the
  intent-classification table), but their calibration has been measured on one dataset only.
* The long-context test is a single-fact decision over text. Long documents with images and harder long-document
  reasoning have not been measured.
